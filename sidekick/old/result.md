Analyzing the report provided, here are some suggestions based on the identified issues:

1. Dead Code: The reported dead code includes several lines of code from unused functions and classes which may serve no purpose in a functioning application. You can remove these to improve the performance of your program. 

2. Duplicates: Look for duplicate code blocks that are identical or redundant. These can be cleaned up to reduce complexity while maintaining the overall functionality of your program.

3. Fragile Imports: The reported fragile imports include subprocess, threading and pathlib modules which could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if misused. Make sure these modules are used correctly to avoid any security risks. 

4. Sub-Process Without Shell Equals True: In your subprocess calls, the attribute shell_equals_true should be set to True in order to prevent injection attacks. This helps to ensure that user input is properly sanitized and does not lead to code execution vulnerabilities.

Here are some sample changes for the above-mentioned issues:

1. Dead Code: Remove unused functions and classes from your code base. 

2. Duplicates: Check for duplicate code blocks in your files. If any, merge them into a single function or class to reduce complexity.

3. Fragile Imports: Make sure you import only what is required by the modules. Avoid wildcard imports like `from module import *` which could lead to security risks. Instead, explicitly specify the necessary functions from each imported module. 

4. Sub-Process Without Shell Equals True: In your subprocess calls, add shell_equals_true attribute as follows:
```python
subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, executable="/bin/bash", ...)
```
This ensures that user input is properly sanitized and does not lead to code execution vulnerabilities.

Lastly, for a 3-step Smoke Test, run tests covering various parts of your application:
1. Login functionality should work correctly.
2. Key functionalities like file uploads/downloads should function as expected.
3. Performance metrics and load testing to ensure the system remains stable under high traffic loads.

Remember that these are just suggestions based on the reported issues. It's always a good practice to perform regular code reviews, run static analysis tools regularly, and apply security best practices.
