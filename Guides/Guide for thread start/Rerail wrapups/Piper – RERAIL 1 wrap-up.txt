Piper – RERAIL 1 wrap-up
What’s stable (keep)

CLI path works (UTF-8 solved).

GUI boot path (when using the KGB you reverted to).

Chat & Logs panes show content; basic autoscroll behavior works on the KGB.

State dot updates with state transitions.

Dev tools → buffers: messages flow into chat/logs correctly.

What’s parked (do NOT touch in the new thread until later)

Heartbeat “seconds” tick in header (live timer).

Side effects we saw: competing update paths, header indicators freezing when timers/painters fight each other.

Aggressive autoscroll logic (re-enable on bottom dwell).

Parked due to subtle interactions with your existing scroll flags.

What broke during experiments (so we’ll avoid repeating)

Import paths to header parts (scripts.ui.panes vs scripts.ui.pane_parts vs scripts.ui.pane_parts.header_bar) caused runtime import loops.

DearPyGui drawlist size requirement on your build (needs width/height).

Creating DPG items without explicit parent caused “Parent could not be deduced” exceptions.

Adding a second “painter” in app_gui_entry.py caused header labels to freeze (double refresh paths).

Recommended baseline to start Rerail 2

Use your last known good snapshot (the KGB you just reverted to). That’s our KGB-A02_passed equivalent for Rerail 2.

Rerail 2 – how we’ll proceed (lean + safe)

We’ll keep the rails short, surgical, and one change per micro-step, with a 3-line smoke test each time.

Pre-flight (verify the baseline)

Run these exactly, and only proceed when all look good.

# kill stray python & clear caches
try { taskkill /IM python.exe /F 2>$null } catch {}
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Piper" -Recurse -Include "__pycache__","*.pyc" | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# import sanity
python -m scripts.tests.import_sanity

# CLI quick check
python -m scripts.entries.app_cli_entry

# GUI quick check (no dev input)
Remove-Item Env:PIPER_UI_DEV_INPUT -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
python -m scripts.entries.app_gui_entry


✅ Expected: GUI opens, header shows (no ticking), chat/logs/dot behave.

Phase B (UI Modularization) — new, smaller rails

We’ll only “route” calls; we won’t add timers, painters, or extra state. Shorter code, identical behavior.

B01 — Confirm foundations (no code changes)

Verify these modules exist, otherwise we skip references to them:

scripts\ui\dpg_app.py

scripts\ui\layout_constants.py (class L)

scripts\ui\pane_parts\header_bar.py

Commands:

python -c "import scripts.ui.dpg_app as m; print('dpg_app OK')"
python -c "from scripts.ui.layout_constants import L; print('L OK', L.WINDOW.WIDTH)"
python -c "import scripts.ui.pane_parts.header_bar as hb; print('header_bar OK')"

B02 — Wire header through its module (no behavior change)

Goal: Make panes.py delegate header build/refresh to pane_parts/header_bar.py.
Constraints: No new imports in app_gui_entry.py. No timers. If import fails, fall back to current behavior.

Micro-step B02-a (single file: panes.py)

Add a try import at the top:

try:
    from scripts.ui.pane_parts import header_bar as HB
except Exception:
    HB = None


In init_ui(log_path), if HB exists: call HB.build(log_path=log_path). Else keep current header build.

In refresh_ui(...), if HB exists: call

HB.refresh(
    state_text=state_text,
    heartbeat_text=heartbeat_text,
    tone_text=f"Tone: {globals().get('current_tone','neutral')}",
    sarcasm_text=("Sarcasm: on" if bool(globals().get('sarcasm_on',False)) else "Sarcasm: off"),
    tailing_text=...  # same logic you already use
)


Else keep current label updates.

Smoke test (B02-a)

python -m scripts.entries.app_gui_entry
# Flip tone/sarcasm in dev tools; run wake/help/sleep for state changes.


✅ Expected: identical behavior. If HB exists, it now owns header updates. If not, fallback works.

We’ll do this step together in Rerail 2 with full function blocks so you only paste once.

B03 — Extract right column (logs + avatar) into a part

Goal: Move right-column UI into pane_parts/right_column.py with build() and refresh(); keep logic unchanged.

Micro-steps:

B03-a: create pane_parts/right_column.py with minimal build() that reproduces current UI and a stub refresh() that does nothing yet.

B03-b: change panes.py to call RC.build() where it currently builds logs/avatar (guarded by if RC else legacy).

B03-c: implement RC.refresh() to update log_text and manage badges—using the same flags you already have.

Smoke test (each sub-step)

python -m scripts.entries.app_gui_entry


✅ Expected: no visible changes.

B04 — (Parked) Heartbeat tick

We will not implement live ticking until B01–B03 are stable and short. When we do, we’ll:

confine the 1 Hz timer inside header_bar.py only,

start it after hb_label is created,

use a single provider for the text (e.g., lambda: humanize(last_update_ts)), and

avoid any per-frame painters in app_gui_entry.py.

Practical policies for Rerail 2

One change per step with a micro smoke test.

No new behaviors while modularizing (only move code behind a guard).

All DPG creations must specify a parent (or be inside a with on a known container).

For DPG widgets like drawlist, always give width/height in your build function for your DearPyGui version.

If a part/module import fails, never crash—fallback to the old path.

Avoid double painters/timers; the entry script should remain thin (event loop + wiring).

Handy commands & env baseline (keep for future)
# UTF-8 shell & Python (once per shell)
$env:PYTHONUTF8='1'; $env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'; chcp 65001 > $null

# Clear caches
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Piper" -Recurse -Include "__pycache__","*.pyc" |
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# CLI
python -m scripts.entries.app_cli_entry

# GUI (no dev input, tails default)
Remove-Item Env:PIPER_UI_DEV_INPUT -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
python -m scripts.entries.app_gui_entry

# GUI (dev input ON if/when needed)
$env:PIPER_UI_DEV_INPUT = 1
python -m scripts.entries.app_gui_entry

What I’ll need from you to kick off Rerail 2

Confirm which KGB we’re starting from (the zip name or tag).

Run the Pre-flight commands above and paste the short outputs (especially the import_sanity line that says all REQUIRED imports loaded successfully).

Then I’ll give you the exact full function replacements for panes.py (B02-a), tested to be guard-safe and short—so we can finally start shrinking code without breaking behavior.
