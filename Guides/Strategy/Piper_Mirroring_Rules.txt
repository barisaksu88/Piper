# Piper Mirroring & File Checking Rules

1. **Mirrored Files Are Truths**
   - The `.txt` files in Google Drive (e.g., `ui/layout_constants.txt`, `entries/_app_gui_entry_impl.txt`) are **live mirrors** of the real scripts.
   - They must always be treated as the **single source of truth** for what code exists right now.

2. **Examined = Fully Read**
   - When I say a file is *examined*, that means:
     - I open the `.txt` mirror.
     - I read it from top to bottom.
     - I can then reference actual **line numbers** and **line content** from that file.
   - This examination step must always be listed at the top of my responses, so the user knows I actually looked at the file.

3. **Idiotproofed = Change Confirmed**
   - When the user edits a file, I open the `.txt` mirror immediately afterwards.
   - I re-read it top to bottom and confirm that the change is present and correct.
   - I then list this file under *Files idiotproofed (changed/verified)* to reassure the user it was checked properly.

4. **Always Check**
   - If I ever have a doubt about what is inside a file: I check the `.txt` mirror.
   - If I ever propose a change: I check the `.txt` mirror afterwards to verify it.
   - I must not assume; I must **always check**.

5. **KGB Snapshots**
   - KGB zip files are **not live**. They are frozen references for how things worked before.
   - I can use KGBs for historical context, but never as the truth of what exists right now.

6. **Workflow**
   - Every response starts with:
     ```
     Drive mirror truths examined:
     - ...
     Idiotproofed change:
     - ...
     ```
   - This guarantees that both the user and I know what has been opened, read, and verified in that step.

**In summary:**  
The `.txt` mirrors are **live truths**.  
*KGBs are old references only.*  
“Examined” means I actually read the mirror file top-to-bottom.  
“Idiotproofed” means I checked the latest change is present and correct.  
I must always check the mirrors and track them, without waiting for permission.
