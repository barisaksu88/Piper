Accomplished

UTF-8 mojibake scrub (CLI+GUI)
Replaced problem glyphs (→, –, stray Â·) with ASCII (->, -, ·). Result: no mojibake in chat/logs; CLI “Flow:” line renders cleanly.
Files touched earlier: core_commands.py, UI header strings.

Sleep command parity
Ensured sleep shows a visible reply path (“Going to sleep.”) and correct state transitions. Verified in CLI and GUI logs.

Header: single authority + hygiene

Moved all header UI to pane_parts/header_bar.py (dot + labels).

Removed duplicate inline header code from _panes_impl.py.

Fixed double “State:” (now static “State: ” + dynamic name only).

Switched dot to drawlist circle and centralized set_state_dot.

Removed stray/continuous separators; cleaned under-header line.

No fallbacks; no duplicate tag IDs.

Layout alignment and spacing

Tightened gaps: header↔copy-row and copy-row↔panes use the right constants (SPACE.GAP).

Chat column placement fixed (parenting + spacer logic); logs symmetrical.

Introduced / honored offsets so small global nudges are possible without reflow.

Theme & title bar

Introduced a functioning light-blue palette path (global + per-pane) and removed the global “blank theme” override that previously reset colors to grey.

Removed the white Windows title bar via viewport.decorated=False (borderless window).

Bound pane theme to root/chat/logs/avatar so major regions follow the palette (some minor areas remain grey; acceptable for now).

Residue scrub (code hygiene)

Dropped duplicate imports in _panes_impl.py.

Routed root position through constants (L.WINDOW.OFFSET_*).

Made pane theme colors match the light-blue palette when enabled.

Fixed a mojibake comment and unified avatar constants with aliases (HEIGHT/MIN_HEIGHT → mapped to PANEL_H/MIN_PANEL_H).

Cleaned fallback imports and dead code discovered during audits.

Rails / canvas kept in sync
Collapsed finished rails; kept a lean Known Issues: none state; added the big red banner rule at the top of the canvas.

Failed (or abandoned for now)

Full theme unification across all widgets
Some sub-widgets still render in default greys. We stopped short of a full audit of every bound theme/component to avoid churn; current state is acceptable to you.

DPG bootstrap peel (I06) & tick/parse extract (I07)
Not executed yet (prior threads struggled). We prepared the plan and confirmed wrapper availability, but did not merge to avoid destabilizing a working GUI.

Make every layout constant “live”
We discovered constants defined but not yet wired (e.g., HEADER.BOTTOM_GAP, CHAT.INSET_*, some component autosize flags). We wired the critical ones but did not refactor every component path.

Issues (open / observed)

Theme coverage: A few areas still render grey (non-critical). Root/chat/logs/avatar are blue; minor items may need explicit binds or component-level theme parts to match.

Component vs. pane_parts duplication: Chat/logs exist in multiple builders; the authoritative path works, but duplication remains a latent risk.

Autosize in component builders: Some components (components/chat_pane.py, components/logs_pane.py) historically used autosize_* which can ignore layout_constants if those paths are invoked. Current main path respects constants, but these should be normalized eventually.

Constants clarity: We added/kept aliases for avatar sizing to avoid breakage; a single naming scheme should be chosen later.

Rules, Preferences, & Corrections (to carry forward)

Golden Rule (capital letters, persistent):

ALWAYS CHECK THE LIVE MIRRORS IN THE DRIVES BEFORE PROPOSING CHANGES.
(Use Dropbox/Google Drive TXT mirrors of the actual .py files. Verify and cite exact lines. No guessing.)

Response / workflow rules

Mirrors-first gate in every patch:

MIRRORS (file + line refs) → 2) BEFORE→AFTER minimal diff → 3) WHY → 4) SMOKE → 5) ROLLBACK.

No fallbacks, no duplicates: Remove dead code, avoid duplicate authority, strip try/except import fallbacks unless required.

Single-authority header: Only pane_parts/header_bar.py builds header UI. Others only place it.

All geometry in layout_constants.py: No magic numbers in panes/components; wire constants where missing.

Patches live in code, not the canvas: Rails in the canvas are for guidance; do not paste code there.

Investigative approach: When behavior surprises (e.g., “no effect”), assume alternate code paths or autosize overrides; confirm by reading mirrors.

Tone/language: Use English by default; only Turkish if you do or if asked.

Minimalism: Every file/function must have a purpose; remove fallbacks/duplication rather than letting “something else” catch it.

Theme rules

Do not bind a global blank theme that overrides custom palettes.

When an env theme is enabled, ensure per-item themes mirror the global palette to avoid resets.

Keep legibility (dark text on light-blue backgrounds); verify hover/selection contrast.

Rails discipline

Keep rails concise; collapse done items; keep Known Issues empty unless real.

KGB tags on successful steps, smoke tests for each slice.

Park non-critical tasks explicitly with where/when they’ll be tackled.

Environment Changes (current state)

Borderless viewport: dpg.configure_viewport(0, decorated=False) — removes the white Windows title bar.

Theme flag: PIPER_UI_THEME=lightblue recognized (global + pane-mirrored); yields pale light-blue backgrounds with dark text in main regions.

(Earlier experimental encoding envs were tried during debugging but final fix was switching glyphs to ASCII; no special encoding envs required now.)

Handoff (what the next thread should do first)

I06 — DPG bootstrap peel (park-lift) [High priority]

Delegate lifecycle (create/show/start/destroy) to ui/dpg_app.run.

Ensure theme application and decorated=False still occur in the correct phase.

Keep tailer/thread/tick scheduling behavior unchanged.

Risk: prior attempts failed due to ordering and missing callbacks; use mirrors and keep the diff minimal.

I07 — Tick/parse extract [High]

Move _refresh_needed/GUI loop helpers into ui/helpers/gui_loop.py to reduce entry size and keep logic centralized.

Confirm “last change” (heartbeat) still ticks and state changes update header/dot.

Theme unification pass [Medium]

Inventory any remaining grey regions; bind them to pane/global theme appropriately (no global overrides).

Verify hover/selection/scrollbar colors in both panes for readability.

Constants wiring cleanup [Medium]

Finish hooking any “dead” constants (e.g., ensure any component builders no longer use autosize_* that bypass layout_constants).

Pick a single authority for chat/logs (component vs. pane_parts) and delete the other.

Quality of life (Optional)

Add a small “× Exit” button in the header (since window is borderless) to call dpg.stop_dearpygui().

Consider a tiny “drag zone” or keyboard shortcut for moving the borderless window if needed.

Standing guardrails for the continuation thread

Start every change with MIRRORS-FIRST proof (file+line cites).

Keep patches surgical; one slice at a time with a smoke.

No code duplication or fallbacks; constants only.

Keep the canvas rails tight and green quickly; park what’s not essential.

If you want, I can spin up the continuation with I06’s exact before→after diffs ready to paste, based solely on the current mirrors.
