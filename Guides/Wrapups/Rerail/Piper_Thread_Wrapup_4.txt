# Piper — Thread Wrap-up (2025-09-09)

This file summarizes all progress, failures, rules, and context adjustments made in this thread. It is intended as the handoff for the next thread.

## ✅ Accomplishments

- **Cleanup Mini Rails** fully executed and tagged into KGB milestones.
- **Removed dwell system** (`last_display_switch`, `advance_state_queue`, etc.) → confirmed obsolete with future model integration.
- **Header heartbeat cleanup**: replaced stray `set_hb_text` calls with `_hb.set_state_dot`; stabilized heartbeat keeper snapshot.
- **Quarantined legacy shims**: `services/asr_vosk.py` and `services/wake_porcupine.py` moved to `services/old/`; imports in tests updated.
- **Canonical imports**: rewrote references to use modular adapters (`asr/vosk_adapter.py`, `wake/porcupine_adapter.py`).
- **Renamed logging module**: `common/logging.py` → `common/log_utils.py` to avoid stdlib collisions.
- **Size trims**: `_app_gui_entry_impl.py` reduced significantly; `ui/_panes_impl.py` now ~262 lines, `ui/panes.py` slimmed to 10 lines.
- **Architecture tree** updated in Canvas with roles (Core/Services/UI).
- **Call graph** consolidated and validated against mirrors, showing correct UI refresh chain.
- **Rules reinforced**:
  - Shell edits forbidden (PowerShell/regex mass edits banned).
  - Mirrors are single source of truth (Drive/Dropbox) — must always be consulted.
  - New response discipline template standardized.

## 🟨 Failures / Reverts

- Attempted **DPG bootstrap peel** into `ui/dpg_app.py` broke due to shell edit mis‑insertions (SyntaxError). Reverted to `KGB-2025-09-09_H02b_entry_uses_gui_loop_helper`.
- Attempted **set_hb_text purge** caused missing heartbeat. Partial cleanup applied; fallback preserved.

---

## 📖 Rules & Guardrails Added

1. **Shell edits forbidden** — all edits must be given as before/after patches within replies.
2. **Mirrors Hard Gate** — if Drive/Dropbox mirrors not accessible, assistant must halt with one-line:  
   `> Need Drive/Dropbox access to continue.`
3. **Auto‑unpark** — railmaster decides when/how to unpark parked steps; no asking which to do first.
4. **Canvas discipline** — Always-Read section overrides all else. Canvas and mirrors must be reconciled continuously.

## 🚧 Known Issues

- Avatar scale is wrong (zoomed-in). Fix requires `layout_constants.py` knobs and `ui/helpers/avatar_fix.py`.
- Autoscroll stickiness in chat/logs. Fix requires `ui/helpers/scroll_utils.py` plus append sites in `chat_pane.py` / `logs_pane.py`.

---

## ⏸ Parked

- **DPG bootstrap peel** (`_app_gui_entry_impl` → `ui/dpg_app.py`). Will be retried in Phase H02b after the entry stabilizes further.

## 📌 Current Rails (as of wrap-up)

**Phase H — Cleanup & Closure**  
- H01 — Remove dead placeholders → ✅ done  
- H02a — Remove dwell remnants → ✅ done  
- **H02b — Entry split (thin glue)** → 🟨 in progress (**we are here**)  
  - Slice 1: use `gui_loop.update_panes` from entry → ✅ done  
  - Slice 2: DPG bootstrap peel → ⏸ parked  
  - Next: move tick/parse helpers → ◻️ pending  
- H02c — Avatar scale fix → ◻️  
- H02d — Autoscroll tuning → ◻️  
- H03 — Wrap & snapshot → ◻️  

Other Phases:  
- B01/B03, D01/D02, F01 → ✅ done  
- C01/C02, E01/E02, G01/G02 → ◻️ pending

## 📂 KGB Tags (this thread)

## 📑 Guidance for Next Thread

- Pick up from **Phase H02b**: finish slimming `_app_gui_entry_impl.py` into `ui/dpg_app.py` and other helpers.
- Keep an eye on **avatar scaling** and **autoscroll tuning** in Phase H02c/H02d.
- Always enforce **no shell edits** and **mirrors-only checks**.
- Ensure **Call Graph + Architecture** in Canvas stay current after each edit.
- Known issues → park/unpark logic should be railmaster-led, not user-prompted.
