Objective: peel Dev Tools out of Piper‚Äôs GUI and consolidate into a standalone Mission Control (MC).
Result: ‚úÖ Success ‚Äî MC now handles all testing, monitoring, and quick actions. Piper scripts folder is clean, old dev_tools removed.

‚úÖ Achievements

Mission Control (stable):

Double-clickable entry point.

Sections: Imports, Helpers, Snapshot, Logs Tailer, CLI Runner, Watchdogs, GUI, Main.

CLI: command input box with auto-focus + trailing into GUI.

Watchdogs: start/stop, hidden windows, live state (working/standing by/last change).

Snapshots: PS1 invoked, last 5 shown.

Logs: live tail, auto-scroll, breathing room at bottom.

Processes: Start/Stop GUI/CLI integrated.

Dev Tools Tab: quick actions, watchdogs, env toggles.

Old Dev Tools removed: no more ui.dev_tools, dev_controls_mount, dev_adapters, PIPER_UI_DEV_INPUT.

Persistent memory aligned: MC is canonical Dev Tools entry point.

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Non-Issues

Stop buttons not critical since windows are closable.

Blue ‚Äúcan‚Äôt run on this PC‚Äù windows solved by moving to proper py/bat wiring.

Logs duplication fixed.

Snapshot initially froze, now works.

üîú Next Rails (if/when ready)

Resource Guard tab ‚Üí live CPU/RAM/GPU stats inside MC.

Archival/log rotation ‚Üí weekly zip of logs/snapshots.

Polish ‚Üí improve visual layout, replace deprecated add_same_line with groups.

Longer term ‚Üí expand MC to monitor external tools (ComfyUI, llama.cpp runs).

üìå Rails Status

Baseline / KGB: current MC state in canvas, stable.

Phase A complete: Dev Tools peeled & consolidated.

MC is now the single point of truth.
